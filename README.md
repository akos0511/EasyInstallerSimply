# EasyInstallerSimply

This is just a a simplified version of [EasyInstaller](https://github.com/Kyiro/Fortnite-ManifestsArchive). Original one made by Kyiro!
Huge shoutout to VastBlast for making the [FortniteManifest Archive](https://github.com/VastBlast/FortniteManifestArchive)!

This is made to prevent the children that are trying to get "old fortnite ðŸ‘¶" but download an iOS or Android Manifest!

## Builds from 16.00+ do NOT work with either Rift or Era. Although Neonite can be used to access Events and builds past 16.00.

Useful Discord servers for Builds that are in the EasyInstaller.exe:

Neo Mods (Used to play events past 16.00): [Neonite Mods Discord Server](https://discord.gg/n9MAV7HZUk)

Era (Used to play Fortnite builds ranging from 2.5 to 12.41 (Subject to change)): [Era Discord Server](https://discord.gg/Erafn)

Rift (Used to play Fortnite builds ranging from 1.7.2 - 15.50): [Rift Discord Server](https://discord.gg/Riftfn)




# How to install builds

Step 1: Download the Alpha Release and run it.

Step 2: Type the number in [ ] in the prompt after you select what drive

Step 3: Set a Directory for the build to download at. For me, I would do `C:\Users\{PC USERNAME}\Desktop\Fortnite Builds` and extra folders will be made from the Manifest.
To find the directory open File Explorer and locate this,

Click on this, and press Ctrl+C (do not press +)

Once you have copied it, paste it in `start_download.bat`.

Step 4: Wait, depending on your internet speeds, your download time may vary. This cannot be fixed from us. If it wont continue and is stuck on a specific percentage for quite a while, clear up some space and start the download again. You might not have enough storage on that drive. It should tell you that you are able to close it. That is when it is done!

Step 5: Once done, add your build to the Era or Rift Launcher, and launch the game. If everything goes correctly, nothing bad should happen.


## AMD Graphics Issue


AMD PC's have issues with seasons 1.7.2 - 1.11. The following .zip has the dll's to fix that issue.

AMD Issue Example:

### [AMD FIX](https://github.com/akos0511/EasyInstallerSimply/files/8928971/AMD_Fix_1.zip)

To find where to drag these dll's, open the game files of the build you have downloaded that has this issue.
For Example, locate `C:\Users\{PC USERNAME}\Desktop\Fortnite\FortniteGame\Binaries\Win64`and drag

into the Win64 Folder.

**Side Note: You only need to do this once, it should then fix permanently with the builds that have these issues.**
